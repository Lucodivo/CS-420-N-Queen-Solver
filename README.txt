FOR BUILDING/RUNNING...
- in the command prompt in a working directory with BoardCoord.java, GeneticQueenBoards.java, 
NQueen.java, and QueenBoard.java
- use "javac *.java" to compile
- when successful, use "java NQueen" to run program

WHEN PROGRAM IS RUNNING...

- The program will produce a random initial Queen Board and will find use Steepest Ascent
  Hill Climb to find a local minimum
- The local minimum solution will be printed to the screen
- The program will then create a population of random QueenBoards and use a Genetic
  Algorithm to find an optimal solution
- The initial population and optimal solution will be printed to the screen
